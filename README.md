# RISTORANTIS

The portal is organized into three distinct parts: 
  • The public part: here you can consult restaurant information (address, email, telephone, GPS location, etc.) and consult the daily specials of the restaurants; 
  • The private part (authenticated users): here the users perform the permitted tasks. Customers can search for dishes of the day by keyword and/or type; edit lists of 
    favorite dishes and favorite restaurants. The restaurants record the dishes of the day. You can reuse previous dishes (copy);
  • A backoffice: where one of the administrators can create other administrator users; accept registration requests from restaurants; manage users;

Other Features: 
  • Customers are characterized by a name, email, username/password. 
  • Restaurants are characterized by name, username/password, contacts (email, telephone), photo(s), location (address, gps), opening hours, day off, type of service 
    (local, takeaway, delivery). 
  • Administrators are characterized by an email, username/password. 
  • The dish of the day is characterized by type (meat, fish, vegan); price; description; photo (optional); date. 
  • The registration of a restaurant is done on the portal, and will be confirmed by an administrator, registering which administrator accepted the registration. Only 
    after validation can you enter the information 
  • Administrators can block access to users (clients and/or restaurant) indicating the reason for blocking. A blocked user is informed of this reason when trying to log 
    in.
